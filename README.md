## IQ Quiz Game
This project is an interactive IQ quiz game that involves multiple levels with different types of questions. The game has a leaderboard, and the player's IQ score is calculated based on their performance.

## Features
Levels: The game has three levels with different difficulty questions (Easy, Medium, and Hard).
Multiple Question Types: The quiz includes True/False questions, multiple choice questions, and word scramble challenges.
Leaderboard: After the quiz, the player's IQ score is calculated, and they are added to a leaderboard.
Games: Two extra games (Scramble Word Game and Number-to-String Game) are included to make the quiz more fun.

## Game Flow
Welcome: A greeting message and instructions are displayed to the user.
Level Selection: The player proceeds through three difficulty levels. Each level presents a set of randomized questions.
Question Display: Questions are shown along with multiple-choice options or true/false options.
Score Calculation: The score is tracked as the player answers questions correctly. The player's IQ score is calculated based on their total score.
Leaderboard: After the quiz, the playerâ€™s score is added to the leaderboard, showing the top players.

## Requirements
C++ Compiler: A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, MSVC) is required to compile and run the program.
File Paths: Make sure to change the file paths in the code to point to the correct locations on your system where the question and instruction files are located.
